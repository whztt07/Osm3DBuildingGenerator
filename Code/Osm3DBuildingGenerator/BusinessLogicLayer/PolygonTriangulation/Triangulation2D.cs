        // without holes has at least two so called 'ears'. An ear is a triangle with two sides on the edge
        // of the polygon and the other one completely inside it. The algorithm then consists of finding
        // such an ear, removing it from the polygon (which results in a new polygon that still meets
        // the conditions) and repeating until there is only one triangle left.

        // the algorithm here aims for simplicity over performance. there are other, more performant
        // algorithms that are much more complex.
